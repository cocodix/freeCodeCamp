                He was the best scorer of the Yugoslav First Federal League for seven seasons, which was a record. He
                scored a total of 5,185 points, in 169 games played in the Yugoslav League, for a career scoring average
                of 30.7 points per game. In 1962, in a Yugoslav First Federal League game against Mladost Zagreb, Korać

                scored 71 points in the first game of the series, and 99 points in the second game of the series, for a
                series scoring average of 85 points per game.[5] He averaged 54.8 points per game that season, which is
                the highest single-season scoring average in the EuroLeague's history, since 1958.</p>
            <p>Korać's career scoring average in the EuroLeague was 43.6 points per game. He was also the best scorer
                in the Belgian League in 1968, while playing with Standard Liège, and the Italian League's best scorer
                in 1969, while playing with Padova.</p>
            <p>With Yugoslavia's senior men's national team, he scored 3,153 points in 157 games played, for a scoring
                average of 20.1 points per game. He was the leading scorer in the 1960 games.</p>
