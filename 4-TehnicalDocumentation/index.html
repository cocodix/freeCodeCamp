                <p>The IMT factory was founded in 1947 as the Central Foundry. In 1949, a new company, the Metal
                    Institute, was formed by amalgamating the Central Foundry and four other local companies. The Metal
                    Institute became the Industry of Machinery and Tractors (IMT) in 1954. The following year, research
                    was conducted on different types of tractors and the Massey Ferguson licence was chosen.</p>
                <p>In 1959, the factory was reconstructed and production capacities for 4,000 tractors a year were
                    built. The factory started production of a tractor of their own design in 1964. In 1988, IMT
                    recorded its largest annual production in history - 42,000 tractors and 35,000 machines.</p>
                <p>Between 1990 and 2000, changing economic circumstances led to significant changes in production. A
                    long-term co-operation was established with the Perkins company, and the first engines complying to
                    the EU 2000/25/EC standards were built in 2005.[4] In 2008, the Serbian Privatisation Agency
                    launched a tender process for the sale of IMT.[5] In 2012, IMT introduced a new "S" series of
                    tractors.[6] Offer of the new generation of tractors together with purchasing power demanded
                    customisation of tractor accessory. Mostly new models have join of traditional and modern look,
                    thanks to the Belgrade professional schools, Faculties of Design and IMT design studio.

                <p>Most popular type of IMT tractors was IMT 533 (with 33 hp) and IMT 539 (38 hp). These tractors become
                    popular in Yugoslavia, because they were easy for maintenance, easy to handle, manoeuvrable,
                    rotatable. Popularity is resulted by spreading of mechanisation and (that time) modern technology on
                    rural parts of country. Later model was produced in 1965. It was IMT 555. Reliable of these three
                    types is in characteristics of the engine. These engine could stand for 20000working hours to the
                    general repair.</p>

                <code>IMT 5200-5500 models were among the ten biggest tractors on the world market in '80s and '90s.</code>
